# Diabetes-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
# Overview 
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Common symptoms include frequent urination, increased thirst, and heightened hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications. Acute complications may include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or even death. Long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and vision impairment.

# Dataset Description
This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The dataset is constrained to include only females aged 21 years or older of Pima Indian heritage.
#Objective
The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether or not patients in the dataset have diabetes.

# Dataset Detail
The dataset includes multiple medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include:
1.Number of pregnancies
2.Body Mass Index (BMI)
3.Insulin levels
4.Age
4.And other relevant features

# Result
After conducting XGBoost hyperparameter optimization, the resulting model achieved the lowest cross-validation score, making it the most accurate model developed for this task.
